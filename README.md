gbxutils
========

Utilities for manipulating Trackmania maps and possibly more.

Status
------

This project is embryonic and doesn't do much useful yet. At the moment it can
only load a gbx file, partially parse it, and save a JSON representation, using
the `tojson` tool.

Goal
----

The main aim is to allow large scale copy, transform and paste operations in
Trackmania Nations Forever maps. There are two possible ways this project can
achieve that, but I don't know which one (or both) will be implemented.

1. Provide a library to make it easy to write scripts that select and
   manipulate blocks flexibly. This is a simpler option for this project, but
   more difficult for 3rd party users.

2. TMNF maps can be imported into Trackmania 2 Stadium, which has a much more
   powerful editor, including copy, transform & paste. However, after a map has
   been saved by TM2 it can't be loaded back into TMNF. This project may be
   able to provide a tool to convert TM2 maps back into TMNF format, as long as
   no new or custom blocks have been added.

Technical details
-----------------

The code is written in Javascript and should be run with
[gjs](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gjs) via shell script wrappers provided in
the project root. Gjs does work in Windows AFAIK, but you'll have to work out
how to install and use it yourself, and convert the shell scripts to batch files
or whatever. Alternatively, it should be trivial to convert the code to run in
[node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
